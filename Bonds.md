# Bonds
### Prices
> [!NOTE] The relationship between bond prices and interest rates
> When interest rate increases, people are able to obtain bonds with higher YTM, this makes the current bond which offers a lower YTM __worth less__: becomes a discount bond.
> Vice versa for when interest rates decreases


> [!NOTE] Relationships
> - Higher coupon payments will have less sensitivity to changes in interest rates
> - Longer maturities will have higher sensitivity to interest rate changes
> - Riskier bonds ($r_e$ is higher) will have lower price

### Yield To Maturity
The expected return if one was to hold the bond till maturity

> [!IMPORTANT] YTM is different from EAR
> 8% semi-annual coupon bond selling at par will have $EAR=(1+0.04)^2-1=8.16\%$ but will have a YTM of 8%
> 
> A bond that has same risk and term as the above, but pays _annual_ coupons instead will have a YTM of 8.16%

Depends only on the maturity and risk. If these are the same across 2 bonds, they will have the same YTM with differing coupon payments.

#### Current Yield

$$ Current\ Yield=\frac{Annual\ Interest\ Payments}{Current\ Bond\ Price} $$
Zero coupon bonds: Bonds which give out no coupons
- Current yield = 0

### Term Structure (Yield Curve)

Inflation premium: reflects the health of the economy. _Investors expect inflation to rise in an economy that is doing well_.
Real rate: does not affect the slope of the curve, only translates the curve.
