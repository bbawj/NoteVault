# P and NP Problems
_Hard Problems_: the best-known algorithm for the problem is expensive in terms of running time

### P Problems
Polynomial time problems.

The class of __decision problems__ that are bounded by [[Polynomial Time Complexity]]. Equivalently:
- They are solvable, deterministically in polynomial time

$P\in NP$ because if a problem is solvable in polynomial time then a solution is also verifiable in polynomial time by simply solving the problem.

### NP Problems
Non-deterministic polynomial time problems.

The class of decision problems for which they are _solvable_ in __polynomial time by a  nondeterministic algorithm.__ Equivalently:
- A guess of the solution is generated by a nondeterministic algorithm
- It can be _verified_ in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm
~~- It cannot be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time~~

> [!NOTE] Why is the Knapsack problem NP?
> Verification:
> There are $2^n$ subsets of n objects: to check all subsets we would need $O(2^n)$ time.
> However, given a guess of a subset: to check this subset we would need $O(n)$ time.
> Solution:
> DP Solution is [[Pseudo-Polynomial Time Complexity]]
### NP Complete Problems

- NP complete problems are equal to each other in difficulty
- Hardest problems in NP
- If a polynomial time solution can be found for an NP complete problem: P = NP
### NP Hard Problems
"At least as hard as the hardest problems in NP".

A problem D is NP-Hard when for every problem L in NP, there is a polynomial time reduction from L to D. Equivalently:
- There is a polynomial time reduction from an NP-Complete problem G to D. _Since all problems in NP can be reduced to G in polynomial time, G is also reducible to D in polynomial time_.

__NP-Hard problems do not have to be in NP and do not have to be decidable.__
