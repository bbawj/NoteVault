# Longest Path Problem
It is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given graph. 

Simple path: if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges. 

In contrast to the [[Shortest Path Problem]], which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative-weight cycles, the longest path problem is [[P and NP Problems#NP Hard Problems|NP-Hard]] and the decision version of the problem, which asks whether a path exists of at least some given length, is [[P and NP Problems#NP Complete Problems|NP-complete]].
