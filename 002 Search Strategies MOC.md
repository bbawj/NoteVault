## Factors for search
- Completeness: Does it always find a solution if one exists?
- Optimality: Does it always find the best solution? [[Shortest Path Problem]]
- Average Branching Factor: average number of successors of any node $$ABF=No.of\ Nodes/No.of\ non\ leaf\ nodes$$
- ## Uninformed Search
	- [[Depth First Search]]
	- [[Breadth First Search]]
	- [[Iterative Deepening Search]]
	- Path Cost
		- [[Uniform Cost Search]]
		- [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
- ## Informed Search (Heuristics)
	- [[Greedy Best First Search]]
	- [[A-Star Search]]
